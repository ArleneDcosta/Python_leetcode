How to check impossible board?

Each row in the board must either equal to the first row or equal to the reverse of the first row.
The same apply to column, but you don't need to check column, because if all rows complies with this rule, all columns automatically 
comply with this rule by themselves. Only need to check rows.
Count of "1" in each row must equal to the count of "0", or at most differ by 1.
Since rule #1 is already passed, you don't need to check every row this time. Checking only the 1st row is enough. But you need to 
check both 1st row and 1st column in this case. Can't skip column this time
When both #1 and #2 passed, it means the board can be tranformed to chessboard.

How to count number of swaps to transform?
Only need to count 1st row and 1st column. When the 1st row and 1st column becomes valid, the rest must be valid by themselves according to rule #1.

Taking 1st row for example.

We don't know whether the first cell should be "0" or "1". Assume it to be "0" first, then we know the expected values of all cells in 1st row.
Count the difference against actual values. The number of swap should be diffCnt/2. If the diffCnt is an odd number, that means the first cell cannot be "0", we should choose "1" as the first cell.
If both choosing "0" and choosing "1" makes even diffCount, then we choose the one with smallest number of swaps.
Same applies to column.

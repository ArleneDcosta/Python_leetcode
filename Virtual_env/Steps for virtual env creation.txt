In ETL_combined
Databasename has been commented

So all the (But the database names are commented) so the source tables of diff db's are created and Jobname is linked to those vertices 
giving wrong outputs


Jobname cannot be mapped to different 
Change 1: Uncomment link in populate_combined
1)ETL has oracle source tables
2)In populate combined db linkage is commented so (oracle db is not linked to oracle source tables)
So in case vertices of different databases are present and created it won't be linked
3)So source tables are only linked to Jobnames
4)Jobnames are linked to target tables 

Change 2: Report add the changes for reports pointing to different target tables====DONE!

Change 3 : Change SAS CSV JSon depending on the changes in input===Done!

Change 4 : Default remove for SAS tables 

Change 5 : Add Db type in populate_combined and populate_ETL

Change 6: Report page remove ambiguous names 
Righthand move

Incoming : Removing all jobs writing different targets
Keeping job writing particular report (Diffeent db's are considered through the code)
---------------------------------------------------------------
1)Dbtype has to be added everythere(get_rid_sas)




exc_type, exc_obj, exc_tb = sys.exc_info()
fname = os.path.split(exc_tb.tb_frame.f_code.co_filename)[1]
print('-----------------Error----------')
print(exc_type, fname, exc_tb.tb_lineno)
print(e)

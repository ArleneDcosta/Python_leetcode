- When the input parameters is very great, and you have to try dp always go for BFS.


Characteristics of a BFS problem:
a) Whenever minimum is mentioned, always go for BFS
b) There will always be states present refer MinnodaystoeatNOranges.py in graph


DFS is trying all possible paths
Recursive method
For DFS , it will be an directed Graph while for BFS, it will be a undirected Graph
ALso in the question it will be mentioned to find the total different paths

# Top down dp template
    def dp(n):
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
    memo = {}
    return dp(n)
